# Security Policy

We take security seriously, and we appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities. If you find a security issue, please follow the guidelines below to report it.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do the following:

1. **Do not open a public issue** in the GitHub repository. This could expose the vulnerability to others before it is patched.
2. Email the maintainers at **[kartikmehta202@gmail.com]** with the details of the vulnerability, including:
   - Description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Any possible solutions or workarounds you have identified.

We will investigate the issue as soon as possible and will work on releasing a patch to resolve the issue. You will be credited for identifying the vulnerability once the patch is released, if you would like to be acknowledged.

## General Security Best Practices

- Always update to the latest version of the plugin to ensure that you have the most up-to-date security patches.
- Do not expose sensitive information, such as Appwrite API keys or Project IDs, in public forums.
- Follow WordPress security guidelines when configuring and maintaining your WordPress installation.

## Response Time

We aim to respond to all security reports within **48 hours** and will work to resolve any security issues as quickly as possible.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure!
